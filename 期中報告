網路與系統安全 期中報告				資財三乙 108AB0728 胡茜雯

EVENT: A software development testing tools from a startup called Codecov was hacked at April 22, 2021.

DESCRIBE: Codecov provides a hosted service that tells developers how much of their source code has been checked by the automated tests that are part of their software build process.
Codecov reads the output generated which execution paths your test code has missed.

Supply-Chain Attacks: A supply-chain attack compromises a supplier or service provider in order to compromise the real targets—all of their customers and users.

The Codecov Attack:
On April 15, 2021, Codecov publicly disclosed that a Bash script used to upload files to its servers had been modified by threat actors. 
The initial compromise at Codecov is thought to have occurred in late January 2021.
The compromised script collected sensitive information from customers’ continuous integration environments and uploaded that information to the attacker’s server. 
Access credentials such as ID tokens and API keys as well as anything stored in environment variables were harvested by the modified script.

By injecting a single line of code into Codecov's Bash uploader script, the threat actors had the means to access the continuous integration environments of all customers that used the script.
And because that script is used in three of Codecov's uploading routines—Codecov-actions, CircleCl Orb, and Bitrise Step, that they have been exposed to the threat of unauthorized access.

Because credentials, connection keys, and other sensitive and confidential information are passed from step to step of the CI/CD process, the threat actors may have harvested those details.
	Any authentication or privilege credentials, tokens, or keys that were accessible to the script while customer CI/CD processes were running.
	Any third-party services, data, or source code that could be accessed by the CI/Cd processes
	The git remote repository details.
